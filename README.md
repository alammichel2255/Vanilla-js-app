# SDI Blended Project 1 Scaffold

## Vanilla JS

The purpose of this application is to provide a solution to the users needs to find different food recipes from all over the world. As part of the team of 
Galvanize's Software Developer Immersive we were given the task of creating a website from the ground up using react and JS along with the API of our choosing for this second project of the course. We decided to go along and create a cook book website that the user can use to search for any dish they want (with the limitations of the free API) and see what all is required for them to make that dish, ingredients and instructions.

### Getting Started

-The application features a search bar which can be used to search a meal by name as long as the user knows the meal they want to search for.
-The user can also search for meals by Category and by Area
-If you find a meal of your choosing we also added the option to add that meal to your favorites and create a list of meals of your choosing.
-If the user doesn't know what they actually want and they're just browsing the app can also dish out a random meal that can be changed by clicking on the VanillaJS icon. If they don't like the meal that has been given to them then they can simply click on the button "Give me another meal" and get another random meal.
-The app can also filter out meals by words using the search bar. If you don't know the entire name of the dish you want you can find it by using key words such as "burgers" for example. Then the app will return meals containing that key-word.
