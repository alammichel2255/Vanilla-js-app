## Ace Coder

The purpose of this application is to provide a time efficient and fun way to practice coding. This application will also allow for the user to change topics and get practice in other areas. The possibilities to learn are endless and a new question library is all that is needed.

### How to Get Started

To begin using Ace Coder:

Ace coder is an online only resource and requires no additional software installation for use, simply load the index.html in your favorite browser (Google Chrome reccommended). Once you have arrived on the home page, simply shuffle the deck to generate a randomized assortment of questions and draw a card to see the challenge. To change the topic you are working with, use the navigator located in the top left corner to generate a deck based on the current topic. This will allow you to begin drawing cards and answering challenges pertaining to the selected subject. Your score is kept for each correct answer so that you can track your daily progress!
